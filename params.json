Driving an awareness to link what treatments drive and optimize patient health and safety is paramount and difficult - unless you are approaching it semantically. Many of the social tools used today are global such that data collection through social media is quite popular. The linking of such broad information to gather and unveil the ambiguity of costs and benefits is the first step towards awareness - the first step. The next step is the hard and costly part of the problem - the design of a medicinal treatment that will positively impact the patients and their families lives in a cost effective manner. We are fortunate to live in 2016 - where science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) is advancing quite rapidly. The problems that society has tackled are impressive indeed - however the challenge of data overload is paramount.  \r\n\r\n#### Important Dates\r\n* Submission deadline: tdb\r\n* Notification of acceptance: tdb\r\n* Camera-ready versions of accepted papers: tbd\r\n* Workshop date: tbd\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Program\r\n* TBD\r\n\r\n#### Topics of Interest\r\n\r\nTopics include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\n* Biomedical Data Integration\r\n  * Integration of heterogeneous data sources\r\n  * Data integration using crowd-sourcing techniques\r\n  * Large-scale data integration\r\n  * Data Model Schema and Ontology matching\r\n  * Biomedical Knowledge Representation and Reasoning\r\n  * Biomedical data quality, standardization and normalization\r\n\r\n* Biomedical Knowledge Discovery\r\n  * Machine learning and statistical approaches for biomedical data mining\r\n  * Rule-based systems for analyzing and mining biomedical text\r\n  * Semantic annotation of biomedical text\r\n  * Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction for biomedical text\r\n  * Entity Linking for/between Free Text and Structured Data\r\n  * Data mining and Machine Learning for social media and their application to the biomedical and clinical domain\r\n\r\n* Applications\r\n  * Drug design and manufacturing based on Semantic Data Integration and Discovery\r\n  * Drug repurposing using semantic web technologies\r\n  * Pharmacovigilance and drug/vaccine safety signal identification\r\n  * Novel tools for biomedical data visualization\r\n  * Novel tools for visualizing ontologies, models and reasoning paths to biomedical domain experts\r\n  * Precision medicine and cancer informatics\r\n  * Biomedical data discovery index\r\n  * Big data applications in biomedical domains\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Submission Format\r\n* We seek the following types of submissions:\r\n  * Full scientific papers: up to 12 pages\r\n  * Short scientific papers: up to 6 pages\r\n\r\n* All submissions must be in PDF and formatted in the style of the Springer Publications format for Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).
